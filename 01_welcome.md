# Welcome to Node.js desktop application development

## Introducing Electron and NW.js

* Electron (GitHub)
* NW.js (Intel and Gnor Tech)

### Why build Node.js desktop applications?

#### Desktop to web and back

* Build desktop apps using the same code used for web apps.
* Desktop apps across Windows, Mac OS, and Linux.
* Use Node.js packages.

#### What Node.js desktop apps offer over web apps

* Internet access is not always available.
* An app with a lot of features can become slow to load.
* Working with large files, like videos. (no need to upload on the web first)
* Limits on what the browser can do with local files.
* You have to handle the CSS behavior for each browser.
